The python library used on line 1 is pandas which is used to store data. You can learn more about it here - https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html 

On line 5, discribe() is used which is a featre of pandas. The data shown by it is-

The first number, the count, shows how many rows have non-missing values.
Missing values arise for many reasons.
The second value is the mean, which is the average. Under that, std is the standard deviation, which measures how numerically spread out the values are.

To interpret the min, 25%, 50%, 75% and max values, imagine sorting each column from lowest to highest value. The first (smallest) value is the min. If you go a quarter way through the list, 
you'll find a number that is bigger than 25% of the values and smaller than 75% of the values. That is the 25% value (pronounced "25th percentile"). The 50th and 75th percentiles are defined analogously, 
and the max is the largest number.
